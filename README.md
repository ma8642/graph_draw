This is a program that I created as a final project for my first computer science course, Object Oriented Programming.  I recently rediscovered it and am cleaning up the code and making the program more user-friendly.  Give it a try!fd


# Usage
Before running:
This program was written using the Calico IDE.  That is the ideal IDE to run it on, but if you are not using Calico, make sure you have downloaded the Graphics library for python.

To run on Calico:
1.  Download the file.
2.  Press the green "Run Button."

To run Otherwise:
TBA
