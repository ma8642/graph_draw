This is a program that I created as a final project for my first computer science course, Object Oriented Programming.  I recently rediscovered it and am cleaning up the code and making the program more user-friendly.  Give it a try!


# Usage
Before running:
This program was written using the Calico IDE.  If you do not have Calico you can download it here:  http://web1.cs.brynmawr.edu/Calico_Download
